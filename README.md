# Synology API SDK

> The SDK is still in development and things will be changing as I code it.

The intent of the SDK is to easily call Synology NAS APIs in a consistent manner. My use case will be calling the Synology FileStation API, but it could also be extended to call other Synology APIs by following the established patterns in the SDK.

Besides including some of the FileStation APIs, I will also include some Photo APIs.

Once I complete development, I will be publishing to NuGet.
